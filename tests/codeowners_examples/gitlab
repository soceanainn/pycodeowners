# This is an example of a CODEOWNERS file.
# Lines that start with `#` are ignored.

# Specify a default Code Owner by using a wildcard:
* @default-codeowner

# Specify multiple Code Owners by using a tab or space:
* @multiple @code @owners

# Rules defined later in the file take precedence over earlier rules.
# For example, for all files with a filename ending in `.rb`:
*.rb @ruby-owner

# Files with a `#` can still be accessed by escaping the pound sign:
\#file_with_pound.rb @owner-file-with-pound

# You can use both usernames or email addresses to match users:
LICENSE @legal janedoe@gitlab.com

# Use group names to match groups, and nested groups:
README @group @group/with-nested/subgroup

# Specify Code Owners for directories:
/docs/ @all-docs
/docs/* @root-docs
/docs/**/*.md @root-docs

# Match directories nested anywhere in the repository:
lib/ @lib-owner

# Match only a directory in the root of the repository:
/config/ @config-owner

# If the path contains spaces, escape them like this:
path\ with\ spaces/ @space-owner

# Code Owners sections:
[Documentation]
ee/docs    @docs
docs       @docs

[Development] @dev-team
*
README.md @docs-team
data-models/ @data-science-team

# This section is combined with the previously defined [Documentation] section:
