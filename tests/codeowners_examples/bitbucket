# The CODEOWNERS file shares the same pattern matching syntax for file/directory
# names with .gitignore

# This is a comment.

# Each non-commented line consists of a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repository. Unless a later match takes precedence.
#
# global-owner1@example.com and global-owner2@example.com will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
#
*            global-owner1@example.com global-owner2@example.com

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only js-owner@example.com and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
#
*.js        js-owner@example.com  # This is an inline comment.

# This means that more specific file-level ownership rules
# often drift towards the bottom of the file. If this specific
# file is changed, Steve Driftexpert will be counted as an owner. Rather
# than js-owner as defined above.
#
/src/pullrequests/drift.js       stevedriftexpert@example.com

# Groups can be added as owners, they must be prefixed by
# the workspace name. When a group match occurs, a single
# random user from that group is chosen by default.
#
*.js        @workspace-slug/frontenders

# If something other than the default behavior for group
# matches is wanted, you can explicitly define the
# matching strategy.

# The available matching strategies are:
#    random - select N random user(s) from this group
#    all - select all members of this group
#    least_busy - select N users(s) sorted by the number of open reviews

# Examples:
#
# Select a configurable number of users at random
#
*.py        @workspace-slug/py-owners:random    # same as random(1)
*.py        @workspace-slug/py-owners:random(3) # 3 random users
#
# Sort reviewers by # of active PR reviews DESC and select
# a configurable number of users in that order.
#
*.py        @workspace-slug/py-owners:least_busy    # Same as least_busy(1)
*.py        @workspace-slug/py-owners:least_busy(3) # least-busy 3 people
#
# Always select the entire group
#
*.py        @workspace-slug/py-owners:all
